# Natural Speech Guide

This guide explains how to make your text-to-speech output sound more natural and conversational using special markers.

## Basic Markers

### Pauses and Breaks
- Use `...` for thoughtful pauses (adds "hmm" with natural pause)
- Use `(pause)` for a natural pause
- Use `(long pause)` for a longer dramatic pause

### Emotional Expressions
- Use `(happy)text here)` for happy, upbeat tone
- Use `(sad)text here)` for somber, downcast tone
- Use `(excited)text here)` for enthusiastic, energetic tone
- Use `(calm)text here)` for relaxed, soothing tone
- Use `(thoughtful)text here)` for contemplative tone

### Natural Interjections
- Use `(laugh)` to add natural laughter
- Use `(agree)` to add "uh-huh" agreement sounds
- Use `(think)` to add thoughtful "hmm" sounds

### Voice Variations
- Use `(whisper)text here)` for whispered text
- Use `(loud)text here)` for emphasized text
- Use `(soft)text here)` for gentle, quiet text

### Emphasis
- Use `*text*` for moderate emphasis
- Use `**text**` for strong emphasis

## Examples

### Basic Example
```
Today, I want to tell you about something amazing... (think) It's a story that begins with a simple idea.
```

### Emotional Example
```
(excited)I can't believe what happened next!) The results were incredible... (laugh) You should have seen their faces!
```

### Conversational Example
```
So, what do you think about that? (pause) *Interesting*, right? (agree) Let me tell you more about it...
```

### Complex Example
```
(thoughtful)You know, I've been thinking about this for a while...) (pause) 
It's not just about the technology, (soft)it's about how it changes our lives.)
(excited)And the possibilities are endless!) (laugh)
```

## Best Practices

1. **Use Sparingly**: Don't overuse markers - they're most effective when used naturally.
2. **Context Matters**: Choose markers that match the emotional context of your content.
3. **Natural Flow**: Place pauses and interjections where they would occur in natural speech.
4. **Variety**: Mix different types of markers to create more dynamic speech patterns.
5. **Test and Adjust**: Listen to the output and refine your marker usage based on results.

## Tips for Different Content Types
