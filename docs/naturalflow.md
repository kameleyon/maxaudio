AudioMax V1: Project Guide to Natural Human Speech Synthesis
Goal
Enhance AudioMax V1 to provide natural, high-quality human speech synthesis using LLaMA 90B for content generation, Google TTS for audio output, and various utilities for efficient development. This guide will focus on leveraging existing tools and libraries to streamline the process without reinventing the wheel.
Document Input and Processing
File Uploads: Allow users to upload a full document (e.g., .txt, .docx, .pdf) or enter a brief sentence describing the topic and tone.
Libraries:
Use Textract for extracting text from documents (e.g., .pdf, .docx).
Use Unstructured for advanced document segmentation.
Apache Tika can also help extract and parse content from various document formats.
Content Generation with LLaMA 90B
Prompt Engineering: Set up detailed prompts to guide LLaMA 90B in generating content based on the selected genre (e.g., Comedy, Storytelling) and tone (e.g., Sarcastic, Professional).
Content-Length Control: Adjust the prompt length to ensure LLaMA generates approximately 15 minutes of content.
Chunked Responses for TTS: If content exceeds Google TTS character limits (typically 5000 characters), break it into smaller chunks for synthesis.
Example Prompt Template
Use dynamic prompts tailored to genre and tone:
plaintext
Copy code
"You are creating a {genre} podcast with a {tone} tone. The topic is: '{topic_description}'. Your task is to generate content that will last approximately 15 minutes. Break down the content into an engaging introduction, main points, and a closing. Use storytelling techniques where applicable and maintain a conversational tone throughout."
Script Organization and Tone-Based Responses
Structure the content according to the podcast/storytelling flow:
Script Segmentation:
Introduction: Hook the listener in the chosen tone.
Main Body: Cover the topic, organized into key points or a storytelling arc.
Conclusion: Provide a takeaway or thought-provoking ending.
Tone Control:
Customize content generation based on tones like Sarcastic, Energetic, or Calm by using simple keywords to guide LLaMA.
Sarcastic: "Use witty remarks and a slightly mocking tone."
Energetic: "Keep sentences short, punchy, and enthusiastic."
Calm: "Maintain a steady and composed tone throughout."
Text-to-Speech (TTS) Synthesis with Google TTS and SSML
SSML for Nuance: Use SSML to control pauses, emphasis, intonation, and speed for more human-like speech.
Libraries:
Use Google Cloud Text-to-Speech API with SSML for fine control over speech characteristics.
Predefined Neural voices like us-Kai or us-Luna are recommended for a more natural sound.
Example SSML Implementation
xml
Copy code
<speak>
  <p>Ah, dog lovers unite! <break time="500ms"/> You know, people often ask me, <emphasis level="moderate">"What's your favorite breed?"</emphasis> And my answer is always, <prosody rate="slow">Pitbull!</prosody></p>
</speak>
Combining Audio Segments into a Single File
Chunk Audio: Since Google TTS has a character limit, split the content into chunks, synthesize each chunk, and combine.
Libraries for Combining Audio:
FFmpeg for command-line audio concatenation:
bash
Copy code
ffmpeg -f concat -safe 0 -i filelist.txt -c copy output.mp3
Pydub for Python-based concatenation:
python
Copy code
from pydub import AudioSegment

combined = AudioSegment.empty()
for part in audio_parts:
    combined += AudioSegment.from_file(part)

combined.export("final_output.mp3", format="mp3")
Optional Transcript Editing Interface
Provide an option to display and edit the transcript before synthesizing audio.
Libraries:
React Quill or Draft.js for a rich text editor interface, allowing users to modify text before synthesis.
Additional Libraries and Tools
Here are some open-source libraries and resources to speed up development:
LangChain: For chaining prompts and managing complex workflows with LLaMA, especially helpful for tone management.
FastAPI or Flask: For setting up a backend server to manage requests, routes, and API calls.
Gradio or Streamlit: For creating a simple, user-friendly interface quickly.
Sample Workflow for Content Generation
User Input:
Upload a document or describe the topic in a sentence.
Select genre and tone settings.
Content Generation:
Use LLaMA 90B to generate a 15-minute script based on genre and tone.
Divide the script into chunks if needed for TTS.
TTS Processing:
Convert each chunk to SSML format.
Use Google TTS to generate audio for each chunk.
Audio Post-Processing:
Combine all audio chunks into one seamless file.
Apply additional audio processing if needed (e.g., volume leveling).
Delivery:
Provide the final audio for playback and download.
Allow optional transcript editing if enabled.
Suggested Repositories and Tools for Quick Integration
Google Cloud Text-to-Speech GitHub: Example implementations and usage patterns for TTS API.
Hugging Face Transformers: Additional resources for language models if experimenting beyond LLaMA.
OpenAI Whisper: For automatic transcription if needed.
FastAPI or Flask Examples**: Search GitHub for quick setup templates if needed.
Summary of Next Steps
Set up document extraction with Textract or Apache Tika.
Refine prompt templates for LLaMA 90B to generate structured, genre- and tone-aligned content.
Implement SSML for Google TTS to achieve nuanced audio synthesis.
Combine and post-process audio with FFmpeg or Pydub.
Provide optional transcript editing using a rich text editor.
Deploy and test the workflow, optimizing for smooth integration.
By combining LLaMA 90B for high-quality text generation and Google TTS with SSML for natural-sounding audio, AudioMax can deliver a professional, seamless audio content generation experience.
