# Authentication Documentation

## Overview
The application uses Clerk for authentication and implements a role-based access control system with multiple levels of authorization.

## Authentication Flow

### 1. User Authentication
- Users can sign in using Clerk's authentication system
- Supported authentication methods:
  - Email/Password
  - OAuth providers
  - Multi-factor authentication (when enabled)

### 2. Session Management
- Sessions are managed by Clerk
- JWT tokens are used for API authentication
- Session timeouts and refresh mechanisms are handled automatically

### 3. Route Protection
Two levels of route protection are implemented:

#### Protected Routes (`ProtectedRoute`)
- Requires user to be authenticated
- Redirects to home page if not signed in
- Usage example:
```tsx
<Route path="/protected" element={
  <ProtectedRoute>
    <ProtectedContent />
  </ProtectedRoute>
} />
```

#### Admin Routes (`AdminRoute`)
- Requires user to have admin role
- Supports different access levels (basic, moderate, full)
- Verifies team membership and permissions
- Usage example:
```tsx
<Route path="/admin" element={
  <AdminRoute requiredAccessLevel="full">
    <AdminContent />
  </AdminRoute>
} />
```

## Role-Based Access Control

### User Roles
1. Regular User
   - Basic application access
   - Access to personal features
   - Subscription-based limitations

2. Admin
   - Full application management
   - Access levels:
     - basic: View-only access to admin features
     - moderate: Limited management capabilities
     - full: Complete administrative control

### Permissions System
- Role-based permissions
- Feature-specific access controls
- Team-based access management

### Access Level Requirements
```typescript
type AdminAccessLevel = 'basic' | 'moderate' | 'full';

interface AdminMetadata {
  role: string;
  accessLevel: AdminAccessLevel;
  teamId: string;
  permissions: string[];
}
```

## Security Measures

### Token Validation
- JWT tokens are validated on every request
- Token expiration and refresh handling
- CSRF protection implemented

### Rate Limiting
- API rate limiting per user
- Configurable limits based on subscription tier
- Protection against abuse

### Error Handling
- Proper error responses for authentication failures
- Secure error messages (no sensitive information leaked)
- Logging of authentication attempts

## Testing

### Unit Tests
- Component tests for route protection
- Service tests for authentication logic
- Error handling tests

### Integration Tests
- Complete authentication flow testing
- Role-based access testing
- Session management testing

## Best Practices

### Security
1. Always use HTTPS
2. Implement proper CORS policies
3. Use secure session management
4. Implement rate limiting
5. Log security events

### Implementation
1. Use type-safe implementations
2. Follow principle of least privilege
3. Implement proper error handling
4. Use secure token storage
5. Regular security audits
