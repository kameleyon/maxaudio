# Debug System Proposal

For the debug system, we propose implementing a centralized logging solution using ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) to aggregate logs from both the frontend and backend. This will allow us to monitor, search, and analyze the logs in real-time.

Additionally, we will set up Sentry for error tracking and exception handling. Sentry will provide us with stack traces, affected users, and the ability to track issues across releases.

For the console, we will use a combination of `console.log` for development and a custom logging wrapper that can be toggled for production. This wrapper will send logs to our centralized logging system and include additional context such as user ID and session information.

We will also implement performance monitoring using Datadog to track application performance metrics, set up alerts for any anomalies, and provide a dashboard for real-time monitoring.

Once the debug system is agreed upon, we will proceed with the implementation, ensuring that all logging and monitoring systems are thoroughly tested before launch.

Please confirm if this proposal meets your requirements, and we will begin the implementation process.
